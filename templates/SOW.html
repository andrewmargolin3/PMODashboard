    <h1><span class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Project Title:</span> Group 4 Flask Web Application Design & Development</h1>
    <br>

    <h2><span class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Project Overview:</span></h2>

    <p>The project involves designing and developing a Flask web application that serves as a project management tool. The goal is to create a visually 
    appealing and functional interface to manage project tasks, team collaboration, and stakeholder reporting. This includes integrating features like 
    interactive Gantt charts, team profiles, status and progress report templates, and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) visualization. Flask and Jinja 
    templates will be used to ensure consistency and scalability across all pages. The project will be executed in Cincinnati, OH.</p>
